# gitcdn.io

:construction: **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

This is the future home for the code behind [gitcdn.io](http://gitcdn.io). It is a fork of [rawgithack](https://github.com/neoascetic/rawgithack) by [Pavel Puchkin](http://neoascetic.me/).

It is an experiment in proxying Git content via KeyCDN for purposes of fun and enlightenment.

### TODO

- Consolidate sub-domains
- Add Brotli compression
- Create front-end page
- Replace filesystem caching with Redis?
- Possibly support multiple CDN providers (low priority)
